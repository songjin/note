	<p>I have been lived in University for about 3 months. And I am so disappointed in my univistiry.</p>

<h2>Courses</h2>

<p>Our first semster&#39;s courses are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Calculous</li>
<li>Liner Algebra</li>
<li>C Programming Language</li>
<li>Introduce to Computer Science </li>
<li>English</li>
<li>P.E.</li>
</ul>

<p>and I take a elective course, the Fundation of ACM/ICPC contest.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t like mathmatics. the mathmatic education just taught I how to solve boring program. Sometimes I will read some intersting article about math .But it&#39;s no help for examnation.</p>

<p>I know math is important for computer science. But I don&#39;t wan&#39;t do be a computer scientist. I just want to use some computer technolegy, to build some useful tools, and make life better.</p>

<p>I have some programming experiences before univisity. So I am not care of courses like C porgramming language. </p>

<p>English and P.E. did&#39;t take mush time. And I think do exercise and learning english is important.</p>

<h2>Activities</h2>

<p>When I am typing the word &quot;Activity&quot;, I just think it&#39;s a interface of Android Applicationâ€¦</p>

<p>University Life is freedom. Some studnets work hard, or join some just playing computer games, </p>
