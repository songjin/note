I have been lived in University for about 3 months. And I am so disappointed in my univistiry.

## Courses
Our first semster's courses are:

- Calculous
- Liner Algebra
- C Programming Language
- Introduce to Computer Science 
- English
- P.E.

and I take a elective course, the Fundation of ACM/ICPC contest.

I don't like mathmatics. the mathmatic education just taught I how to solve boring program. Sometimes I will read some intersting article about math .But it's no help for examnation.

I know math is important for computer science. But I don't wan't do be a computer scientist. I just want to use some computer technolegy, to build some useful tools, and make life better.

I have some programming experiences before univisity. So I am not care of courses like C porgramming language. 

English and P.E. did't take mush time. And I think do exercise and learning english is important.
## Activities

When I am typing the word "Activity", I just think it's a interface of Android Applicationâ€¦

University Life is freedom. Some studnets work hard, or join some just playing computer games,
