Learning Computer Technolegy is different with many other subjects.You can find so many resource in the Internet.And can learn it by yourself, without any techers.

I just talk about Computer Technolegy, not the Computer Science and Computer Theory.Computer Technolegy is a Technolegy that build computer sofewares, web applications, mobile applications, or just edit a picture with Photoshop.


### Way to Learn Computer Technolegy

1.  The best way learn them is by following the tutorial, reading the books for beginner, or watching the teach vedio and other ways you like to do.

2. Then you can make things you would like to make. Try to build some project you like.

3. And in the process you also should learn some theories, and sum up some methons.And you can make better tools with computers.

This ways, learning by doing , can give you more sense of achievement. When you finish you own project, you will fill very relaxed and have much acheivement. And you will have more interest in learning.

For example, If you a student major in Computer Science like me, or relative field. You may have many class about computer theory, like Computer Network, Compiler, or other class that look like far away with skills you really need in the future work. As a matter of fact, most sudent will becommer a software engineer rather than a commputer scientist after graduated. How to make the theory and application togather?

- When you learn computer network, you can make a simple downland tools, which achieve some function of `wget`

- When you learn Complier, you can make a simple interpreter or `complier`. or invent a `DSL`. like a `markdown` parser, a DSL like coffee script.

- When you learn System Programming , you can write Unix tools, like `ls`, `wc`, `grep`, or you own `shell`.

I'm now learn mobile application development, I want to make some application that I need to use, my own To-do-list App, RSS Reader, etc.

### Disappointing School

I think a good school will teacher student that, but I'm so disappointed with my school and most university/colleage in China. Their major work, or main work is make the school's reputation better. Many Professor or teachers care their own life, researh funds, not students' life.The will told student work harder, finish homework on time, get good grades. And the lesson arrange is not good.

<b>But we study is just for examnations? What a fuck university!</b>

<b>We study for getting more knowlegeble, learning skills,  improve ourselves , know more about the world, and make the our life better, make the world peaceful and better!</b>
