Rails is a awesome Framework, it's so convenient to build web application by Ruby on Rails.

###  Why Use Dymatic language

Compare with C++, Java, Ruby is a interesting Language.Dynamic Language is more convenient to write small script. e.g.  Do you like write a "Hello World" like these 
	
	#include <stdio.h>
	int main(int argc, const char* argv[])
	{
		printf("Hello world!\n");
		return 0;
	}
	
Or like these
	
	puts "Hello World"
	
The static language's advantage is 

* It can be profile by complier or interaptor and have faster running speed. 
* Have less type error because it's can be checking by compiler or interaptor.

Thanks to the computers's inductory's development, now we have faster microprossor and sometimes don't have to care the running speed.In more times, the programer's time is more expansive than machines.

### Why use Ruby on Rails, not Python with Django Framework 

Python is another popular language, and it's also a popular language to build web application. But Ruby is more flexable. But

* Rails Framwork is more powerful than Django or ther Python Web Framewrok
* The Ruby's communication also more creative. Rails use the newest technolegy, use them as the default, such as Scss and coffee script.

### Learning Ruby on Rails is Simple


There a famous image to compare Using Java and Rails to build application

![Java vs Ruby on Rails](http://www.nagarro.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/java_vs_ruby1.jpg)

Also Rails dont't have long history, there are lot's of resource to help new commers to study Ruby on Rails.I will introduce it in the blow.

### Leaning Ruby on Rails is Hard

Ruby on Rails is convenient to use, but it's just for experience developers.There are many new technolegy use in Ruby on Rails,e.g.

* The *nix command line use
* Version Controller: Git
* Basic Web Page Build: HTML, CSS, and Javascript
* Basic HTTP Protorl
* Ruby Programming Language

If you a newbie like me, you will find it's hard to study Rails, or just follow the book step by step, but don't why how to do these.


And for most people whose native English is not English, there native language's book or resource may be lack, or outdated(The Rails always changed frequently).

### How to start Ruby on Rails

* First, your should have basic skills of computer use. And know some basic of Web devlopment,such as HTML and CSS.

* I really recommand to study Ruby first. In splite of you don't need to write many ruby statement in the begin, you will found Rails use many advantage features of Ruby Language. 

* you can try Sinatra, it's a DSL of build web application, it's light and easy to learn. e.g, you write a "Hello World!" in Sinatra just like these :
  

	
		get '/' do
			"Hello world"
		end
   


I'm also new to Ruby on Rails, so I don't have ablity to give you some advice.I just collect some advice of learning Ruby on Rails, some resource. I list them in the below to your refrence. 

At the times when I can use Rails write some small web application and no longer a newbie, I will write a passage to share my exprience.
