My First Programing Language is Pascal. I start programing for the purpose of join the NOIp, a algorithm　contest for middle school students in China, and for my interseting of explore the world of computer programming.

I even don't hava my own computer at that time. I have contest class one night a week at the school's computer room.I just write some simple code to solve some sample algorithm problem, using some simple algorithm just like quick sort.


After servrel months, I realize I should learn something by myself.I buy CLRS, the textbook of MIT, one of the best university of the world, which is also a top school in the world in Computer Science Filed.

I learn a lot from CLRS, and meanwhile  I read some other good books and do a lot of algorithms problems. I start visit some English Website such as USACO, and do some ACM/ICPC's Online Judge's problem. I learn C at that time, for reading other's code writing in C/C++.

I didn't got a good prize in the contest, But I learn a lot.I have a strong programming and algorithm foundation, and have ability of study computer technolegy by myself.


In China there is a Exam called the College Entrance Examination. So most students in China just do lots of practise in Grade 12. I stop programming at Nov.2011.

After the Examation, I back to my computer. I change my computer and start using Linux(My old laptop's hardware isn't support Linux). I learn a litte Python, the I switch to Ruby.I have interset in web development. So I learn some about it.Like Django, web.py, Ruby on Rails, Sinatra, HTML, CSS, etc.But I don't keep on studying them.(I am so lazy~)

I also interest in mobile development. In my University I join a Mobile Application Development Club. I start learning Java, and start making simple Android Application. And then I buy a Macbook Air, start learning Objective-C, and iOS Programming.

Some times I feel I'm away from Computer Science now. I just use the API of the SDK. I don't think some problem, just search the probleam in the Internet.I can write longer code than before.But it's　logic is so simple.

And I thinks I learn to much aspects. I learn Web, Android, iOS, my time is separated. I know a litte in everything, but I don't have a ablity to do some awesome application.


I have a lot to learn. I shouldn't waste to much time.


TODO

- Learn more about Android, and take aim at iOS after I successsful join iOS development program
- Learn computer utility，programming language and theory, build some useful program, and start own open source project


And I will explore the world, to open my eyes, and find other interesting things, and do I should, and want to do.
